# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Graphical user interface built with Swing.
- Two-player gameplay: X and O.
- Highlights the winning combination.
- Randomly assigns the first turn between X and O.
- Notifies the player whose turn it is.
- Determines the winner or a tie.
- Restricts further moves after a win or tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the application.
2. X starts the game, and the players take turns by clicking on an empty cell.
3. The game ends when a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or all cells are filled without a winner (a tie).

## Instructions to Run

To run this application:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the source files: `javac *.java`
3. Run the main file: `java Main`

## Future Improvements

- Implementing an AI for a single-player mode.
- Adding a score counter for multiple rounds.
- Improving the GUI with better styling and animations.
